A.
I Tested my code by first testing the cases that weere given to me and added a couple of entries into the CSV in order to test both
port ranges and Ip address Ranges. I also Tested the Time that the program takes to run by creating a large set of Data so that i could gauge how well
the algorithm handles large datasets. With almost 50k entries in the csv file I didnt even notice that there was that much data being read into the program.

B.
I decided that the easiest way to implement the range for the IP adresses was to split the string at every '.' character so that i could check if each of the
number groups was in the range specified since each IP adress must have 4 groups of numbers. I initially thought about using the python range() function to make
a sublist of the range but realized that that solution would take significantly more space that just comparing each of the sublists one by one.

C.
If i had more time, I would have sorted the inputs based on inbound and outbound and tcp and udp so that if im sure that the first parameter is not inbound or
outbound, then i would be able to start looking for the correct packet or packet range from there. For example if there is only one inbound and the rest of the
inputs are outbound, then i would have to look through the whole loop until I find the packet that starts with inbound. This would greatly improve the amount of
time that it takes in order to find the input that I am looking for.
